System configuration files
==========================

Here you can find all relevant configurations. This is thought equally as
public viewport and backup. I appreciate suggestions, rants and bug reports :)

requirements
------------

My configuration expects some repositories checked out in `~/src/pkg/`:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/src/pkg
git clone https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen.git ~/src/pkg/zgen
git clone https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug ~/src/pkg/vim-plug
```

I also use [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3-gaps) and
[i3blocks-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3blocks-gaps) from Airblader.
